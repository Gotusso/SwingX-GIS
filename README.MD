SwingX-GIS
==========

Map component for Swing.

This is a fork from the original project [swingx-ws](https://java.net/projects/swingx-ws) to provide a way to display GIS
information in a Swing application. The lib is stable and it's currently used at NxRay enterprise
application from [Swiss Mobility Solutions](http://www.swissmobilitysolutions.com), however the API still can change a
bit.

Please, feel free to send us any pull request or open a new issue.

Main changes are:
* Multi layer maps
* Support for custom layers
* Maven integration
* Small usability improvements
* Removed unnecessary classes for map visualization
* Many bugfixes
